                Ansible
Create 4 Servers ( Ubuntu 18 )
1 is controller
3 are managed nodes
   I have named the instances as
Controller
Server1
Server2
Server3
Connect to Server 1:
Establish password less ssh connection
$ sudo passwd ubuntu
( lets give the password as pavani only )
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
change 
PasswordAuthentication yes
Save and QUIT
$ sudo service ssh restart
$ exit
Repeat the same steps in server2 and server3
++++++++++++++++
Now, Connect to controller
Now , We need to generate ssh connections
$ ssh-keygen
Now copy the key to managed nodes
$ ssh-copy-id ubuntu@172.31.33.49 ( private Ip of server1 )
$ ssh-copy-id ubuntu@172.31.40.194( private Ip of server2 )
$ ssh-copy-id ubuntu@ 172.31.45.56( private Ip of server3 )
Installing ansible now
Connect to controller.
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
( software-properties-common , is a base package which is required to install ansible )
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y ansible
+++++++++++++++++
To check ther version of ansible
$ ansible --version
Write the ip address of nodes in the inventory file
$ cd /etc/ansible
$ ls
$ sudo vim hosts
insert the private ip addresss of 3 servers
172.31.33.49
172.31.40.194
172.31.45.56

save and quit
$ ls -la ( to see the list in the current machine )
$ ansible all -a 'ls -la' ( you will get the list of the files in all managed nodes )
